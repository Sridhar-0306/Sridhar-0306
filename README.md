## About Me
Hi, I'm Sridhar U, a Computer Science Engineering student currently engaged in project-based learning using web technologies, backend systems, and databases. I use web development primarily as a supporting layer while focusing on understanding backend logic, data flow, and real-world system behavior.

My long-term interest lies in Cloud Computing, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, and I am actively building the foundational skills required to grow in these areas.

### Current Work
- Project-based implementations involving backend logic and database integration  
- Applications where data storage, querying, and data flow are core components  
- Using application development as a medium to understand system behavior  

### Currently Learning
- Python with a strong interest in data handling and automation  
- Databases, SQL, and data modeling concepts  
- Fundamentals of Data Engineering, Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning  
- Cloud fundamentals and scalable data systems  

### Collaboration Interests
- Data-centric and backend-heavy projects  
- Beginner-friendly Data Engineering or analytics projects  
- Learning-focused projects involving Python and databases  

### Looking for Help With
- Understanding data pipelines and system-level design  
- Applying machine learning concepts to structured datasets  
- Improving data modeling and backend efficiency  

### Ask Me About
- Python learning workflows  
- SQL and database fundamentals  
- Project-based learning using AI tools  
- Transitioning from application projects to data-focused systems  

### Note
I use projects as a learning tool — my goal is to deeply understand data systems rather than focus only on building interfaces.
